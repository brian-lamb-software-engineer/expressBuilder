<a id="welcome-to-expressbuilder" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-expressbuilder" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to expressBuilder.</h2>

<p>This package is for advanced developers who know their way around task managers and npm, and just want a quick launching point. This builder is also brilliant for new and eager up-starts who are eager for a way to get their foot in the door with useful and worth-while open-sourcey skills, learning how to build and manage scaleable HTML5 JavaScript applications using a terminal, node, and gulp alone.  </p>

<p>Its up to you if you need to access files through an IDE as an extra step. Its easy enough to network share the project dir that your building, and edit/build from your IDE across some network. Its just easy.  You will have to either skip to the <code>Easy setup</code> section from here, or Read on to continue, depending on your level of patience.  Tap-on die-hard coders!</p>

<p>Using this builder gives you a way to fully control what type of application, and to help you get it out the door fast. It doesn't matter what tools you want to choose from to do the job.  Using npm only is encouraged.  This is an anti-bower-need, anti-grunt-need setup to keep things really slim. Any projects GitHub repo URL can simply be added into the gulp task, called "vendor",  whether its a RUBY / readthis app, a raw bare-bones framework that your creating in any design pattern, or an Angular/Redux masterpiece, this is a great launching point.  </p>

<p>Kick off right away with a working site, with CRUD.  The main example uses Express/Mongo with MongooseODM.  The site includes a database, with a RESTful API/CRUD.  </p>

<a id="live-reload" class="anchor" href="#live-reload" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Live reload</h3>

<p>One of the primary features that is core to continue to function flawlessly on all builds of expressBuilder is Live reload.  Live reload is integrated into <code>gulp-live-server</code>  so that a watch can be set both on the src build files, and again on the build dir so that after they are compiled they can come up on save (less than a second on all devices).  This is superb when your developing RWD, CSS and TEMPLATE authoring, even client and server-side js.  This takes efffect on every device/browser opened on the LAN, in a second, by the press of save on your IDE, or :w on vim.  This works without  browser extensions allowing you to immediately reap from any browsing device. </p>

<h3>
<a id="easy-setup" class="anchor" href="#easy-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Easy setup</h3>

<ul>
<li>git <a href="https://github.com/brian-lamb-software-engineer/expressBuilder.git">clone</a> into your projects dir onto a machine that has a working nodejs installation configured and ready to run <code>npm</code> (can be through a terminal, so long as the port for node is available, currently that is port 3003, you can change it)</li>
<li>cd to the app root dir, run <code>npm install</code>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="first-steps-for-orientation" class="anchor" href="#first-steps-for-orientation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First steps for orientation</h3>

<ul>
<li>run <code>gulp all</code>
</li>
<li>open any device browsers, browse to url (http://ip:port) where your running gulp, e.g. (<a href="http://192.168.1.6:3003">http://192.168.1.6:3003</a>) or (<a href="http://sharedhosting.com:3001">http://sharedhosting.com:3001</a>) etc.. </li>
<li>see that the application loads, be excited to test Live Reload working next!</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="first-steps-for-development" class="anchor" href="#first-steps-for-development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First steps for development</h3>

<ul>
<li>branch the app, so you can start development</li>
<li>cd to the app dir, <code>gulp all</code>(reducing to <code>gulp</code>) until you get a clean output and browser refresh, then commit these core changes</li>
<li>Peek and orient yourself with the client-side source files 

<ul>
<li>cd to the <code>src/</code> see models/controllers/views<br>
</li>
<li>Edit and save a file, watch gulp, and device output. (adjust any gulp tasks to your likings)</li>
<li>
<strong>This is the amazing part</strong>, watch your page come back to life right away as the gulp task brings it back online.  The application automatically reaches back out to its mother-ship on all devices that still have it loaded!!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Peek at the middle-ware <code>index.js</code> file in the app root which bootstraps the app</li>
<li>Peek at the back end node server in bin/</li>
</ul>
