      h4 A complete Express based web stack scaffold and development toolkit.
      p Introducing the first official complete NEMM web bundle. The NEMM stack is based on Node.js server, Express.js framework, mongoDB and Mongoose ODM. It's similar to the "mean" stack, just one step decoupled with a well known tasker, some imperative tasks tailored more towards small business, to enterprise level web specific development, and with a whole lot of scalability!
      p expressBuilder is a toolkit which will help achieve a very rapid web application prototype, which is both scalable and immediately usable. It's greatest feature is its meant to be used as the ground-level engineering scaffold for a new product.
      p This builder uses Gulp  as it's task runner. It incorporates many open-source repositories most of which are related to compiling your source to build, tasks such as linting, minifying, uglifying, compression and the like.  There is one brilliant task that fires up a live-reload server, and a file watcher, so that you can begin to live-edit immediately on your source files, and watch them automatically reload in multiple browsers the second you save.  This feature alone should greatly expedite responsive development.
      p The vendor tasks include a working sass, bootstrap and jQuery implementation. Add more / change as you like by copying one of the Gulp compile-vendors task examples, then add an entry to get it loaded on your client-side view template (e.g. script / src tag).  Now you just re-run three quick tasks, compile-vendors, build, then develop.  You are now back in live-reload development mode, have fun!
      p Measures have been taken to avoid having to use bower, grunt, and the like in order to keep things simple.  For example, at the time of this writing, the bootstrap-sass docs don't yet have documented a way to implement this straight into gulp, and others who have, used bower. This would be pointless to add bower simply to get npm modules into a directory.  The vendor specific tasks on the gulpfile will guide you on how to accomplish this.
      p A word on the web application which is the actual output of this build: This is is a standard JavaScript / HTML5 specification client-side web ui.  The middle-ware of this web application is not just static templates, it contains a SOA web service which has an API (see controllers). A CRUD layer which acts on this API layer is included to help fast-track, as a full-suite.
      p During version control, don't commit anything until you can successfully run the "gulp develop" command, without seeing any lint errors, etc.., Then you would want to stop the server and commit your changes, then restart.
